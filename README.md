Quote unicef - 1 of 5 of world out of school kids in Nigeria. UNICEF.org/Nigeria/education -- done

Something about poverty being a barrier to keeping girls in school

Goals:

1. Financially sponsor girls in school. Provide schools with desks, bore holes etc
2. Interest free loans to women to start a small biz

Donate: by mail/online/gifts of securities (stocks, bond, etc.)
Support U: Volunteer/Fundraise/Pray
Right now, volunteers needed to open their home and host a small group for drinks and conversation about the program and request donations/ideas
Fundraise: We provide women with fuel (resources) but they are the engine doing the work of learning or building their small business. Most people do simple "peer to peer" fundraising for a specific project or women on their heart or as an alternative gift for birthdays or Christmas. Add a click here if you would like for us to help you set up a giving page or if you are interested in something more.
Then we should have the ability to create a giving page for birthdays etc.
Section for Newsletter – likely quarterly (when I retire) and maybe a subscribe to our newsletter section.
