Donate: by mail/online/gifts of securities (stocks, bond, etc.)
Fundraise: We provide women with fuel (resources) but they are the engine doing the work of learning or building their small business. Most people do simple "peer to peer" fundraising for a specific project or women on their heart or as an alternative gift for birthdays or Christmas.
